# MUSA 5000: OLS Regression Homework #1

## Note from Tessa: Alex did the report outline and had done some write-up, I placed the code into the appropriate sections AND placed in my observation notes, please feel free to move the note texts I made around for the project report. The professor gave an example how the descriptions and observations are supposed to look, I bullet-pointed my notes and he wants them in paragraphs.
